## Ensuring code, programs or software is functional and secure

To ensure code is function, you can implement unit testing, integration testing and system testing.
All of these combined will ensure you meet requirements, uncover unforseen bugs and reliability and maintainability.

## Interpreting user needs and incorporation them into a program

A programmer must gather requirments, as without these, you will not have a basis to work off of. Collecting user stories
is one way to develop use cases and create functional requirments. You may also create a requirementes documents
overviewing functional and non-functional requirments that you must meet before you can release the project at all.

## Desinging software

You must appraoch software design by understanding the problem; gather your requirements and understand them and the constraints
of a project. Know what is possible and what isn't, gain knowledge of the project usecase if needed. Use design principles to
assist the development of code, sch as the SOLID principles. Document and review your projects at the end to ensure everything
was met.
